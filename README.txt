Measuring Stability Using the Reflection API

-----USER GUIDE------
In this project I calculated the positional stability of classes in a JAR file.

To use this you must
1. Have a jar file and gets its path
2. Enter its path were instucted in the Runner class and make sure it ends with the name of the JAR file, for example, /downlods/Reflection.jar
